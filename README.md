# HN Link Finder

HN threads a gold mines for interesting stuff. I've found numerous interesting softwares and articles from HN threads. But when there 100 comments on a discussion, it becomes extremely hard to parse all that and find stuff.

HN Link Finder allows you to see all the links on a HN page. This gives you a quick glimpse of all the links that were shared. You can even go and check out the original thread where the link was shared.
